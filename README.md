The Analysis of and responses to extremist narratives (**ARENAS**) project looks at extremist narratives that affect political and social life in Europe. It examines the nature of these narratives and seeks to understand the discourses they impact, particularly about science, gender and the nation. By understanding how these narratives work, ARENAS will empower people to resist them. To foster a spirit of people living together in harmony across Europe, policy recommendations will be made as to how to prevent such narratives from taking hold in the future. Project also will provide a design of practical instruments and guidelines for the creation an operationalization of tools to mitigate the distribution of extreme narratives in Europe, especially for civil society organizations, enterprises, and youth.¬†
